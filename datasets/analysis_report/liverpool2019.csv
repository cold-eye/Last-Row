Fulham 0 - [1] Liverpool,,"When Mane has the ball in the side lane, the half space between Fulham's SBs and CBs can be seen to be Liverpool's due to the visualisation of the pitch control. He then made good use of the space to open up a great shooting spot."
Genk 0 - [3] Liverpool,,
Bayern 0 - [1] Liverpool,,"The moment a through pass from van Dijk, the back space belonged to Bayern, but Salah's tremendous speed and good turnaround allowed him to score."
Southampton 1 - [2] Liverpool,,"The reason why Southampton's DF and goalkeeper were mis-positioned was due to Firmino's parallel running. As can be seen from Pitch control's visualization, the space on either side of Southampton's DF has always been Liverpool's."
Bournemouth 0 - 3 Liverpool,,"The space behind the DF line, which belonged to Bournemouth when Nabi Keita was driving, changed to that of Liverpool just before the pass. One possible reason for this is Salah's increased speed. In fact, the speed of each player is included as a parameter in the pitch control calculation."
Liverpool [1] - 0 Everton,,"Origi's sprint gave Liverpool little pitch control, but Mane's precise passing allowed him to score."
Liverpool [3] - 0 Bournemouth,,"We can confirm that the destination of a through pass to Firmino and a pullback to Salah has always been Liverpool's pitch control. Bournemouth's defence allowed them to score because they were slightly unable to keep up with the speed of their timing."
Liverpool [1] - 0 Wolves,"After a side change from Mane to TAA, Wolves's defensive formations continued to expand vertically and horizontally.","After Mane's side change to TAA, he used Liverpool's pitch control on the right flank to create a free cross. In addition, despite even pitch control in the penalty area in front of the cross, the TAA's ability to pass the ball into space just in front of the DF line was outstanding."
Liverpool [2] - 1 Chelsea,"It shows that Firmino run made Chelsea defense block stretch vertically.","And the visualisation of the pitch control confirms that Firmino's running pulled down Chelsea's DF line and consequently left Mane's great shooting spot open."
Liverpool [3] - 0 Norwich,,"Just before the TAA pass, we can confirm that there was almost no Liverpool pitch control at the destination of Origi's sprint. However, he was able to score with a needle-hole pass. (Liverpool [1] - 0 Wolves as well.)"
Liverpool [2] - 0 Porto,"After pass from Firmino to Henderson for side changing, The visualization of the stretch index shows that Porto's defensive formation continued to spread out lengthwise and horizontally. You can learn the importance of carrying the ball into open space.","TAA's crosses were easy compared to the rest of the game, as evidenced by the last-minute pitch control in the penalty area, with Liverpool dominating most of the space between the GK and DF lines, indicating that Porto were clogged up, and it was important to attack early after the Stretch Index was extended."
Liverpool [2] - 0 Everton,"After a side change from TAA to Mane, Everton's defensive formations continued to expand vertically after failing to keep up with the speed of Liverpool's counter-attack.",
Liverpool [2] - 1 Newcastle,,"This goal doesn't seem to have been a major omission in Newcastle's defensive formation from the point of view of PITCH CONTROL. However, if the goalkeeper had been a little more forward positioned at the moment Salah started his sprint, he might have been able to clear the space behind the DF line."
Liverpool [2] - 0 Salzburg,"It shows that perfect pass from Henderson to TAA made Salzburg's defensive block spread horizontally. That's why Liverpool were able to score a cross in the penalty box.","Liverpool [2] - 0 Porto was a very similar situation and we were able to get some pitch control by jumping into the penalty area early against a cross after a side change."
Liverpool [2] - 0 Man City,"After a side change from TAA to Robertson, Man City's defensive formations continued to expand vertically after failing to keep up with the speed of Liverpool's counter-attack.","Just before Robertson's cross, you could see that Liverpool dominated most of the space between City's goalkeeper and the DF line, even though the positioning hadn't changed much. This could be attributed to the physical speed of Liverpool's attackers. Speed is strength."
Liverpool [1] - 0 Watford,"The surge in the Stretch Index after the pass from Mane to Salah suggests that the event has spread Watford's defensive formations vertically.","From the pitch control at the moment Salah received the ball, we can see that the option of flowing and shooting with his left foot, which he excels at, in addition to the actual cut back and shot, wasn't too bad either. an integrated analysis with exG might show Salah's decision to be good or bad."
Leicester 0 - [3] Liverpool,"Milner's deep right-wing pass to TAA opened up Leicester's defensive formation and opened up a spot for Firmino's shot in front of the DF line.","Despite even pitch control in the penalty area in front of the cross, the TAA's ability to pass the ball into space just in front of the DF line was outstanding.(Much like Liverpool [1] - 0 Wolves.)"
Liverpool [4] - 0 Barcelona,,"TAA didn't miss the pitch control in front of the narrowly-born Origi as Barcelona's players densely packed into the penalty area."
Porto 0 - [2] Liverpool,,"We can confirm that the destination of a through pass from TAA to Salah has been Liverpool's pitch control. Porto's defence allowed them to score because they were slightly unable to keep up with the speed of their timing."
